This simple application maps the AT91SAM9260 system controller into
  user space to access the controllers peripherals such as GPIO, ADC, etc.
  In this program the ADC channels are read periodically.

AT91SAM9260.h was taken from open-source

The board pin-out information is available at the KwikByte website:
www.kwikbyte.com/KB9260/docs/KB9260_pinout.pdf

and also available from the KB9260 product page:
www.kwikbyte.com/KB9260.html

If you are using the sample buildroot cross compiler tree from
  KwikByte FTP server (copied to your root at /), you can build
  with "make" command.

If not, edit the Makefile for your compiler (top lines):

BASE_TOOLS=/buildroot/build_arm_nofpu/staging_dir/bin
CC=${BASE_TOOLS}/arm-linux-gcc
LD=${BASE_TOOLS}/arm-linux-ld


By default, the application is built as a static binary so no libraries
  are required on the target.  Also, debugging information is included
  so you can debug this image.

If you want to reduce the size of the image, make sure libraries are installed
  on the target and change the Makefile (LDFLAGS) so that the image is not
  statically linked and debug information is not included

Most people will not want to do this because this program is just a simple
  example anyway.

After you transfer the image to the board, make sure the file has the correct
  permissions.  You can view the permissions with "ls -al adc_app".  You can
  set permissions with "chmod 755 adc_app".

Execute the program with "./adc_app"

--------------------------------------------------------------
Transferring the program to the board:

If the app is not already on the board, you can do one of the following to
  get it there:
  1) Mount NFS share and copy to local directory
  2) Copy to USB disk from PC, then copy from USB disk to board
  3) Use TFTP  <- easiest method

TFTP:
 NOTE: some installations use eth0 while others use eth1 ***
 NOTE: Debian uses a different command for tftp: tftp <server_ip>
        Then, get <filename>

  Verify the network configuration with "ifconfig eth0".  If you did not
  set the IP, you can do so here with "ifconfig eth0 y.y.y.y".  
  Now, "tftp -g -r adc_app h.h.h.h" where the 'h' characters are the IP
  address of the TFTP server: e.g., your host PC running a simple TFTP server
  program.  Now, check the file permissions (see above) and run the program.
  You will see the ADC values reported on the serial terminal!
